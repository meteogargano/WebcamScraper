# WebcamScraper
A tool that I use for downloading webcam images.   

## USAGE
`python wscraper.py -u <url: string> -d <delay: int> [-c]`  
`-u` - This is the url where the image is downloaded from.  
`-d` - This is the delay from one ping to another in seconds.  
`-c` - This option is optional, it disables the ANSI shell colors.
